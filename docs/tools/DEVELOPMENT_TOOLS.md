## Project Management Tools

### Q1: Jira Project Management

**Question**: How do you configure Jira for banking application development with compliance and regulatory requirements?

**Answer**:

**Banking Jira Project Configuration**:

```yaml
# Banking Project Template Configuration

```

**Banking Team Jira Best Practices**:

1. **Consistent Naming**: Use BANK-XXX prefix for all tickets
2. **Compliance Tracking**: Mandatory compliance impact assessment
3. **Security Classification**: All tickets must have security classification
4. **Definition of Done**: Standardized across all banking projects
5. **Automated Transitions**: Git integration for workflow automation
6. **Regular Reviews**: Weekly backlog grooming with compliance focus
