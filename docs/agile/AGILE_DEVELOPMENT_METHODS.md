### Q2: Sprint Planning Process

**Answer:**
Sprint planning in banking requires careful consideration of regulatory requirements, security implications, and integration complexity.

**Comprehensive Sprint Planning for Banking:**

```javascript

    this.bankingComplexityFactors = this.defineBankingComplexityFactors();
  }

  // Banking-Specific Complexity Factors
  defineBankingComplexityFactors() {
    return {
      regulatory: {
        low: "Standard feature with existing compliance patterns",
        medium: "New feature requiring compliance review",

### Q3: Daily Standups and Communication

**Answer:**
Daily standups in banking development require additional focus on security, compliance, and stakeholder communication.

**Banking-Focused Daily Standup Structure:**

## 📊 Testing in Agile Environment

### Q13: Test-Driven Development (TDD)

**Answer:**
TDD in banking development requires special attention to security, compliance, and financial accuracy requirements.

**Banking TDD Implementation:**

```javascript
// Test-Driven Development for Banking Applications

class BankingTDDFramework {
  constructor() {
    this.testingStandards = this.defineBankingTestingStandards();
    this.complianceRequirements = this.defineComplianceTestingRequirements();

        minimum: 90,
        critical: 95, // For transaction processing and security modules
        target: 98    // For core banking functionality
      },

      testTypes: {
        unit: "Component-level testing with banking business logic validation",
        integration: "Service integration testing with banking systems",
        contract: "API contract testing for banking service interfaces",
        security: "Security-focused testing for financial data protection",
        compliance: "Regulatory compliance testing for banking requirements",
        performance: "Load testing for high-volume banking operations"
      },

      testingPyramid: {

### Q25: Retrospectives and Action Items

**Answer:**
Banking retrospectives require focus on compliance, security, and risk management while maintaining team morale and productivity.

**Banking-Focused Retrospective Framework:**

```javascript
// Banking Sprint Retrospective Framework

class BankingRetrospectiveFramework {
  constructor() {
    this.retrospectiveFormats = this.defineRetrospectiveFormats();
